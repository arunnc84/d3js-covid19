    <p>CS 498 Data Visualization - Summer 2020 - University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign</p>
    <p>Project
      by Arun Narayanaperumal Chellathurai</p>
    <h2>Messaging</h2>
    <p>To analyze covid-19 publicly available dataset and provide High level overview of covid-19 by highlighting 3 data
      points</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Covid Impact across the globe over the last 6 months.</li>
      <li> cases across the globe.</li>
      <li>Provide as of today view of Covid cases across the globe.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Narrative Structure</h2>
    <p>This narrative visualization follows a "Interactive Slide Show" structure. This slideshow has 4 slides in total
      with 3 slides using charts of two different kinds.</p>
    <h2>Visual Structure</h2>
    <p>The interactive slide show is "Linear" and can be navigating either by using
      the page level buttons highligted in green or by using the simple hyperlink along with the text. Users can
      interact with the chart in scene 4 by mouseover to get more details thorugh dynamic annotations. Annotations are
      used across all scenes to help the user focus on the messsage author is trying to convey. Every slide has a small
      overview of what the next slide is to make the user interested in the next message author is trying to convey.</p>
    <h2>Scenes</h2>
    <p>The slideshow consists of 4 slides.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduction</li>
      <p>Introduction about covid19.</p>
      <li>Covid Impact across the globe over the last 6 months.</li>
      <p>To start with, this scene is used to provide a picture about how covid 19 started with a small number and
        drastically increased over the past 6 months and also provides information about when it was anounced as
        pandemic.</p>
      <li>Compare data from a Country which succesfully worked around Covid and a country which did not.</li>
      <p>This scene is to provide an overview of data from two countries on how they handled covid differenlty and the
        result from their actions. Annotations are provided to highlight the message</p>
      <li>Provide as of today view of Covid impact.</li>
      <p>The last scene is to provide todays status on covid and the user can hover over countries or legend to get more
        details about the reported and death cases.</p>
    </ul>
    <p> By providing a overall picture first and then bring the focus down to today would make the user understand the
      impact well, like for example financial institutions trying to sell their service provide their overall
      performance overview and then
      compare their services with competitor and finally providing todays offereing. This slide follows the same
      pattern</p>
    <h2>Annotations</h2>
    <p>Annotations used in this interactive slides shows are text with different colors. Red, Orange and green are used
      to highlight the message author wants to communite to the user.</p>
    <p>For instance, in world trend red annotation is used to highlight the timeframe when covid was announced as
      pandemic.</p>
    <p>The same color pattern is followed in Korea Vs United States slide to highlight the dangerous trend observed in
      South Korea and United States. A different color green is used to highlight the possitive trend starting to emerge
      in south korea.</p>
    <p> Sceen All countries have dynamic annotation based on user hover over action on legend to provide more details
      about covid cases across the continent the user has the mouse over.</p>
    <p>Annotations are used like voice of the author to guide the user with the message the author wants to convey.</p>
    <h2>Parameters</h2>
    <p>The buttons provided on the webpage navigate to different webpages to change the state of the visualization and
      their by changing their Parameters</p>
    <p>Click on World Trend provides a chart with data from all over the globe for a period of 6 months.</p>
    <p>click on Korea Vs united States provides us with a chart for the same time period, but with two countries in
      focus, their by changing the paramters for the previous chart to focus on trend for these two countries.</p>
    <p>Click on All Countries (7/25) gives us the data for all countries on a particular day.</p>
    <p>Thus providing the user with 3 views from the same dataset filtered by either day or country or no filter driven
      by user button clicks</p>
    <h2>Triggers</h2>
    <p>Buttons are the primary triggers available on top of each slide allows the user to navigate to any given slide
      they are interested in to get more details on.</p>
    <p> Scene "All Countries (7/25)" does have hover over triggers to provide more details (dynamic annotation to
      display more details) about the covid cases across
      continents or countries based on the hover type (legent hover or bubble country hover)</p>
